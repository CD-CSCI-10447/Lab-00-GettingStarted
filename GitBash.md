## **Note**:
Remember that Git Bash provides an emulation of a bash environment on Windows and is useful for using Git with familiar Unix-like commands. If you're used to a Unix-based environment, Git Bash is a great tool to help you transition your version control activities to Windows.

Happy coding!
