# How to Create a New GitHub Account

Creating a GitHub account allows you to collaborate on software projects, contribute to open-source endeavors, and host your own repositories. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a new GitHub account:

## **Prerequisites**:
- An internet connection.
- A valid email address that you frequently use (to ensure you don’t miss out on important notifications).

## **Steps**:

### **1. Visit the GitHub Homepage**:
Navigate to [GitHub's official website](https://www.github.com).

### **2. Click on "Sign up"**:
You'll find the "Sign up" option at the top right corner of the homepage.

### **3. Enter your Email Address**:
- It's very important to choose an email address that you use often. This will be the primary means of communication for account recovery, notifications, and other updates from GitHub.
- After entering your email, click on “Next”.

### **4. Set a Password**:
- Make sure to choose a strong password. It should be at least 15 characters long or at least 8 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Passwords are case-sensitive, so ensure you remember the exact combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

### **5. Choose a Username**:
- Your username will be visible to the public, so choose something that you’re comfortable with others seeing.
- It’s unique to the platform, so if your preferred username is already taken, you’ll need to come up with a variation.

### **6. Solve the Puzzle (CAPTCHA)**:
To verify that you’re not a robot, GitHub might ask you to complete a simple puzzle.

### **7. Review and Accept the Terms and Conditions**:
Before you can proceed, you'll need to review and accept GitHub's Terms, Privacy Statement, and Product Documentation.

### **8. Choose a Plan**:
You’ll have the option to choose between:
- **Free**: This plan offers unlimited public and private repositories but doesn't include advanced collaboration features.
- **Pro**: This is a paid plan with more advanced features.

For most individual users, the free plan is sufficient.

### **9. Tailor your Experience (Optional)**:
GitHub might ask you a few questions about your intentions (like if you want to use it for school, work, etc.) to tailor your onboarding experience. You can fill this out or skip it.

### **10. Verify your Email Address**:
- After you've completed the registration, GitHub will send a verification link to the email address you provided.
- Open your email, look for the GitHub verification email, and click on the link to verify your email address.

### **11. Set up Additional Account Security (Optional but Recommended)**:
Once you're logged in, it's a good idea to set up additional security features like two-factor authentication.

**And that's it!** You now have a GitHub account ready to use.

## **Tips**:
- Keep your login credentials safe.
- Regularly review and update your security settings.
- Engage with the GitHub community by starring projects you like, following developers, or even contributing to projects.

Happy coding!
